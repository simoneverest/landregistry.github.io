      <h1>Digital Service Team Manifesto</h1>
      <p>We are practicing better ways of developing software by following the
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/design-principles">design principles</a> and
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual">service manual</a> in order to pass the
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default">digital by default service standard</a>.
        Through this work we have come to value:<br></p>
      <h2>Agile development culture <small>over prescriptive processes.</small></h2>
      <h2>Open source, standards and data <small>over closed proprietory systems and formats.</small></h2>
      <h2>User needs and research <small>over business requirements and models.</small></h2>
      <h2>Empowered multi-disciplinary teams <small>over segregated silos of knowledge.</small></h2>
      <p><br>That is, while we used to value the items on the right, we now value the items on the left more.</p>

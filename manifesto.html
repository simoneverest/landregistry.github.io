      <h1>Digital Service Team Manifesto</h1>
      <p>We are practicing better ways of developing software by following the
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/design-principles">design principles</a> and
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual">service manual</a> in order to pass the
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default">digital by default service standard</a>.
        Through this work we have come to value:<br></p>
      <h2><a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile/index.html">Agile development</a> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/culture-that-supports-change.html">culture</a> <small>over prescriptive processes.</small></h2>
      <h2><a href="https://github.com/LandRegistry">Open source,</a> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/open-standards-and-licensing.html">standards</a> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/open-data.html">and data</a> <small>over closed proprietary systems and formats.</small></h2>
      <h2><a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-needs.html">User needs</a> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-research/index.html">and research</a> <small>over business requirements and models.</small></h2>
      <h2><a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/governance/governance-principles.html">Empowered</a> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/the-team/index.html">multidisciplinary teams</a> <small>over segregated silos of knowledge.</small></h2>
      <p><br>That is, while we used to value the items on the right, we now value the items on the left more.</p>

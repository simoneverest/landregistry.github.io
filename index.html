    <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry">The Land Registry</a> are working with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service">The Government Digital Service (GDS)</a> to build a new digital service. The service will form a part of <a href=https://www.gov.uk">GOV.UK</a> and is currently in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/phases/alpha.html">alpha</a> phase following guidance in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual">Government Service Design Manual</a> in order to meet the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default">Government Digital By Default Service Standard</a>.</p>
    <p>The service is being built in the open, with the <a href="https://github.com/landregistry">code</a> developed as open source, and the <a href="/architecture/">architecture</a> and other documentation published under the open government licence.</p>
    <p>
      The alpha will be a minimal viable product of :

      <ul>
        <li>The irreducible core of a digital first Land Registry, from the user interface to the system of record, a single digital service that meets the needs of conveyancers, proprietors, lenders and caseworkers while meeting statutory requirements.</li>
        <li>This means the ability to create, store, find, apply to change and change register entries, while showing how fraud can be designed out and security designed in</li>
        <li>It will not have every feature, only the minimum required to operate the service end-to-end, but it will be a useable system that we can test with real users and quickly turn into beta. The ‘spine’ of a system to build upon.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
    <p>
      This will continue to build a digital culture within Land Registry through the adoption of Agile and <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/digital.landregistry.gov.uk/alpha/team">Multidisciplinary Teams</a>
